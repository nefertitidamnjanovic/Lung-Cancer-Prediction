Implemented machine learning models, including k-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, to predict the severity of lung cancer based on patient data.
The project utilized a dataset of 1000 samples and enhanced model accuracy through Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
This work demonstrates the potential for advanced data-driven approaches in improving early diagnosis and personalized treatment of lung cancer.
